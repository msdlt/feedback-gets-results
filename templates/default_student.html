<p>Feedback gets Results holds the results of your coursework and examinations, or 'resultsets'. These will be made available to you either immediately after your tutor has uploaded them into the system, or after you have completed the corresponding feedback. The results are available online, and can also be downloaded in portable document format (*.pdf), or emailed to you in portable document or plaintext format; results will be archived after a certain time, in which case you can contact your tutor for a copy if required.</p>
